Azure Setup Summary
This section outlines the steps performed in Azure to enable the Microsoft Teams chatbot.

Creating an Azure Account:

A free Azure account was created (starting around in the video). This involved providing personal information and potentially payment details for verification.
Registering an Application in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory):

An application was registered within the Azure portal (starting around). This application represents your chatbot and allows it to interact with Microsoft Teams.
During registration, a name for the application was specified.
Configuring API Permissions:

Permissions were granted to the registered application to allow it to access Microsoft Teams resources via the Microsoft Graph API (starting around).
Specifically, the necessary Application permissions were likely granted. The video mentions addressing message permissions later, indicating that permissions related to sending and receiving messages were a key focus.
Generating a Client Secret:

A client secret was generated for the registered application (starting around). This secret acts as a password for your application when authenticating with Azure AD. Important: This secret should be treated confidentially.
Setting up Redirect URIs:

One or more redirect URIs were configured for the application (starting around). These URIs are where Azure AD redirects the user after they authenticate your application. For a bot, this might involve specific endpoints or be less directly user-facing than a web application.
Creating and Uploading an App Package in the Microsoft Teams Developer Portal:

An app package for Microsoft Teams was created (starting around). This package contains metadata about your bot and is used to install it within Teams.
This package was then uploaded to the Microsoft Teams Developer Portal.
Setting up the Azure Bot Service:

An Azure Bot Service resource was created in the Azure portal (starting around). This service provides the infrastructure for hosting and managing your bot.
Configuring the Messaging Endpoint:

The messaging endpoint for the bot was configured within the Azure Bot Service. This endpoint is the URL where Microsoft Teams will send messages intended for your bot. This URL would likely correspond to the webhook URL you set up in your n8n workflow.

## Azure Setup

These steps were performed manually in the Azure portal to configure the Microsoft Teams bot.

1.  **Created an Azure Account.**
2.  **Registered a new application in Microsoft Entra ID.**
3.  **Granted the necessary API permissions to the application for Microsoft Teams interaction (via Microsoft Graph API).**
4.  **Generated a client secret for the application.**
5.  **Configured the required redirect URIs.**
6.  **Created and uploaded an app package for the bot using the Microsoft Teams Developer Portal.**
7.  **Created an Azure Bot Service resource.**
8.  **Configured the messaging endpoint for the bot service to connect with the n8n webhook.**

**Note:** Unlike the n8n workflows (which are provided as `.json` files), the Azure setup involves manual configuration within the Azure portal and the Microsoft Teams Developer Portal. There are no downloadable files representing these configurations.
